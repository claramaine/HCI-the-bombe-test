# The Bombe Test

*For all those afraid of the robot uprising, this game is an interesting take on the scenario from the perspective of fugitive humans that are trying to blend in and live their years out in the new robot-run world.*

You are a human that has slipped up somewhere in your daily robot-like activities and have been flagged for suspicious human behaviour. You now need to pass the most recent variant of the Bombe Test — ideally the opposite of the Turing Test — which aims to confirm that a given entity is a robot. The meaning behind the name ‘Bombe Test’ was because Alan Turing had named his machine Bombe, and given that the idea here is to determine who is machine and who is not, the 
name felt quite apt. 

If you fail the test, you will be exterminated for the scum that you are in the ideal robot world. But if you pass, you get to keep living… until your next slip-up that is. 

See the manual for more information.
